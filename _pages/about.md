As a final-year Statistics student at The Ohio State University, set to graduate in December 2023, I'm passionate about the intersection of statistics and sports. Currently, I'm a Data Science Research Intern at SumerSports, where I leverage statistical techniques to extract insights from sports-related data. I'm excited to apply my skills in the field of sports analytics and contribute to data-driven decision-making in this dynamic industry.
