As a Statistics graduate The Ohio State University, I'm passionate about the intersection of statistics and sports. Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at NiSource. Here, I am learning how to apply data to the utilities industry and have broadend my technical skills in many ways. Previously, I was a Data Science Inter at SumerSports. This gave me the knowledge to leverage statistical techniques to extract insights from sports-related data. I'm excited to apply my skills in the field of sports analytics and contribute to data-driven decision-making in this dynamic industry.
