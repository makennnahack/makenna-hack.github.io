As a graduate in Statistics from The Ohio State University and a huge football fan, my enthusiasm lies at the thrilling intersection of statistics and sports. Currently serving as a Data Scientist at NiSource, I am immersed in the fascinating realm of applying data to the utilities industry, expanding my technical  skills along the way.

My journey into the world of data in football began as a Data Science Intern at SumerSports, a pivotal experience that equipped me with the adeptness to leverage statistical techniques for extracting valuable insights from sports-related data. Here, I'm excited to apply my skills in the field of sports analytics and contribute to data-driven decision-making in this dynamic industry.
