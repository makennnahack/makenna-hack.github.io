Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 11

Starting off strong with the SEC, Georgia contintues to climb the rankings, making it to No. 3 this week. The former national champions put up a 52-17 win against previous No. 12 Ole Miss, knocking them down to No. 20 this week. The Dawgs face another challenge this week at Tennessee, who just came off a tough loss No. 18 Missouri. 

Washington and Oregon both had closer games than they have been used to. Both were knocked down one spot in the rankings this week by Georgia. Washington keeps their record clean off a 35-28 wil against Utah, which actually knocked them out of this weeks top 25. Their offense continues to thrive as Penix thre for 332 yards and 2 TDs, but wen 24-42. Odunze had another good games as well, putting up 111 yards with only 3 recetptions and 2 of those being touchdowns. Oregon beat USC 36-27 with Bo Nix being spectacular again. Nix put up 412 yards and 4 touchdowns with Oregon holding the lead almost the entire game. 

The Sooners beat the upset alert this week in the Big 12 against West Virginia. They put 59 points on Mountaineers, totaling 644 offensive yards, and held West Virginia to only 20 points and 330 yards. The Sooners will likely continue to win these next two weeks after coming off two tough losses. 

As the season wraps up, the more and more the rankings start to finalize. This should pan out to be an exciting last two weeks of the regular season, and carry into the post season. 

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 11!
