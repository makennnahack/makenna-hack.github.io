Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 12

There wasn't much suprises after week 12 in college football. The Top 7 all stayed the same after beating their opponents this week. 

James Madsion was handed their fist loss in overtime this week. They fell to Appalachian State with a 26-23 final. This will unfortunatly knock JMU out of the Sun Belt Championship, but their bowl hopes can still be kept alive. As long as there are not enough teams that make it to 6 wins, there could be a postseason in store as a fist year FBS team.

The greatest game of the weekend came from Washington and Oregon State. The Huskies stayed on top almost all game, but in the fourth quarter they almost allowed the Beavers to come from behind. Washington won 22-20 with a big game from both star quarterbacks.

This is setting up for a huge rivarly week this weekend! 

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 10!
