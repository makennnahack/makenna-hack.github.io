Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 13

Rivarly week shook up the rankings and the games were very thrilling. Starting off in the Big Ten, Michigan came out on top and holds strong at No. 1 and knocked Ohio State to No. 4. The game was a dog fight, coming down to the final minute. Kyle McCord outperformed J.J. McCarthy, but ultimately the Wolverines won the turnover battle and came out on top.  

Over in the SEC, Alabama got revenge for the kick six ten years later. The game stayed close the entire time with Auburn taking a one point lead in the third quarter and then a 4 point lead early in the fourth. The game came down to a 4th & 31 for Alabama with 0:32 left in the fourth quarter. What seemed impossible was very much a reality for Jalen Milroe as he threw a touchdown pass to Isaiah Bond after. Alabama came out on top, keeping their playoff hopes alive. 

Florida State and Washington had big games this weekend as well. It looked down for FSU for awhile as Florida had a 12 point lead at one point. The Seminoles pulled it together, though, without their star quarterback Jordan Travis, and came out on top with a 24-15 lead. Washington, on the other hand, kept the game a lot closer. The Huskies were back and fouth with Washington State almost the entire game. The teams were trading off touchdowns the entire game; Washington got lucky and was able to keep their offense on the field until the end of the game and kicked the walk off field goal. Cameron Ward actually outplayed Heisman contender Michael Penix Jr., but the Huskies playoff hopes will be kept alive going into championship weekend.

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 10!
