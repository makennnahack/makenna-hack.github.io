Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 5

Now that we are about a third of the way through the College Football regular season, there is enough data to beging caclulating my Massey Ratings and Rankings. This is the intital top 25. 

Come back each week as I calculate and post my College Football Top 25 based on the numbers. Each week, as more and more games are played and more and more data is collected from each team, the rankings will get more accurate. This system will numercially give the best teams in order by the end of the regular season. 

One may not agree now, but with each week the data will prove itself and each team will get their deserved rating and ranking.

Here is my intital calulated Top 25 after Week 5, this is the starting point!
