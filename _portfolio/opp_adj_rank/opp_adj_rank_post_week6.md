Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 6

The biggest game of the weekend had to have been The Red River Rivalry. With Texas as the favorites in this game, they let it slip and Sooner's quarterback Dillion Gabriel made the game winning touchdown pass to Nic Anderson with 15 seconds remaining. Oklahoma came out on top 34-30 and elevated themseleves up to No. 2 and the Longhorns hold steady at No. 5. 

In the Pac-12, UCLA found themselves down to No. 15 Washington State at halftime, but totally rallied for the win in the second half. With the Bruins defense picking off the Cougars quarterback Cameron Ward 2 times, winning 25-17 and knocking Washington State out of the top 25 and establishing thmesleves as No. 25 this week. 

Georgia and Ohio State both held of an anticipated upset. Georgia outscored Kentucky 51-13 at home, moving them from No. 18 to No. 7 after the heavy victory. The Buckeyes defense was able to hold a notable Terapins off offsense to 17 points while scoring 37 on them. This led Kyle McCord and the Buckeyes to a ranked victory over No. 21 Maryalnd and moved them from No. 6 to No. 3 this week. Maryland still holds steady just dropping to No. 23. 

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 6!
