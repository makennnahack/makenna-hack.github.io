Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 7

Week 7 was a big week for some teams. Starting with the Pac-12 top ten matchup, Oregon a Washington, two very good teams with very good quarterbacks. Washington scored one final touchdown in the last few minutes of the game to take the lead. They then gave Oregon the chance to score a game winning field goal, but it was missed and the Huskies won the game. Washington moved from 6 to 4 and Oregon fell hard from 4 to 9. 

Notre Dame also made a huge jump after a huge win this weekend. USC could not keep up with Notre Dame and ultimatly got outscored 48-20. This was a much needed win coming off of a loss at home two weeks ago and an upset the week before, moving them from 13 to 8 this week. 

Ohio State outscored Purude healvily this week, as the Boilermakers could not keep up with their passing game. The 41-7 win elevated the Buckeyes from the 3 spot to 2, jumping the Sooners off their bye week.

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 7!
