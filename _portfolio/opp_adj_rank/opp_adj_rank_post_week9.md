Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 9

To start this week off, Kansas upset the Oklahoma Sooners 38-33. This is the Sooner's first loss to the Jayhawks since 1997 and it also puts a blemish on their perfect record this season. This game was kept close the whole way and came down to the very end. Oklahoma dropped from No. 3 to No. 9 this week. 

Taking a look into the Big Ten, Ohio State held off Wisconsin on the road at night with a 24-10 victory. They stay undefeated and hold steady at No. 2 this week. Penn State however narrowly avoided Indiana at home this week. Things were looking down for the Nittany Lions at times, but they managed to pull out a 33-24 win. This did impact them though as they fell from No. 11 to No. 14 this week. 

The two most siginificant jumps this week were Louisville moving from 19 to 10 and Oregon moving from 12 to 3. Louisville had a huge shutout win against No. 14 Duke this weekend, knocking Duke down to a 5-3 record and No. 22 this week. In the Pac-12 Oregon had an even bigger win over No. 21 Utah. Starting quarterback Bo Nix led the ducks to a 35-6 win, passing for 248 yards and 2 touchdowns, knocking the Utes out of the top 25 this week.  

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 9!
