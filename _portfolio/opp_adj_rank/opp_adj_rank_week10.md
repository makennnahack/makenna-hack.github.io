Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 10

At first glance, we see Michigan, Ohio State, and Oregon are holding steady in the top 3. All 3 teams beat their unranked opponets soundly this week. Washington found their way into the top 4 after both their thrilling win over USC and Notre Dame's brutal loss to Clemson. We see the data start to even out with Notre Dame dropping to 16 this week. 

Over in the ACC, Louisville rose up the most this week. After their 34-3 win against Virginia Tech, the Cardinals rose to 7. Their defense has seemed to be on the upward trend after the passed 2 weeks. It will be interesting to see how they finish the season, especially with the potential of playing FSU in the ACC Championship game. (If they make it there). 

Some more minor moves this week include Georgia, Penn State, and Oklahoma. Georgia continutes to win, and finally puts up their second ranked win against No. 18 Missouri, moving the Bulldogs from  8 to 5 this week. Penn State looked rocky against Maryland at first, but eventually ran away with it to beat the Terps 51-15 on the road. This gave them leverage to move up to the top 10. Oklahoma was not so lucky, though, as they fell to Oklahoma State 24-27. This dropped the Sooners two spots for No. 11 and raised the Cowboys from 19 to 14. 

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 10!
