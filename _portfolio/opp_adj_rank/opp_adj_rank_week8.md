Welcome to my weekly college football Top 25!

## Week 8

Starting off in the Big Ten, No. 2 Ohio State took down No. 5 Penn State. This was a defensive battle the entire game, with Ohio State's offense finding breaks whenever they could to outscore the Nittany Lions 20-12. Ohio State's defense held PSU QB Drew Allar to 191 yards and completing 18 for 42 passes. The Buckeyes remain undefeated and hold strong at No. 2 while Penn State falls from 5 to 11 this week. 

Florida State seasoned their resume with another ranked team this weekend, after a big comeback against Duke. They are offically the only undefeated team in the AC. Potential Heisman candidate Jordan Travis threw for 268 yards and 2 touchdowns, and the Seminoles' defense held Duke to only 76 yards passing and 197 yards rushing. This helped FSU to jump from No. 12 to No. 4 this week, while Duke fell from 7 to 14. 

To end the night, there was a thriller in the Pac-12. No. 22 Utah and No. 17 USC ended in a walk-off field goal giving the Utes a 34-32 victory of the Trojans. The game was tied going into halftime, but the Utes started to gain a heavy lead in the 3rd quarter. The 4th quarter though, 3rd-string Utah quarterback Bryson Barnes threw a pick six, giving USC some momentum. USC inched closer and closer taking a one point lead with 1:46 to go. In the end, though, Barnes led the Utes down the field to kick the game winning field goal just in time.  

Here are my calculated rankings for college football after Week 8!
